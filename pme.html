          It enables the employees to understand about theirs and their family's health status and take curative
          steps on time in case there are any irregularities. PME data, if structured, can also help the corporates in
          designing focused health initiatives and provide necessary health services to the employees and their
          dependents. This goes a long way in corporates saving considerable amount of money in healthcare costs. In
          RIL, there are currently 73,000 employees eligible for PME but only a fraction of them (16%) actually
          undergoes the process.

          JioHealth envisions to become an enabler towards corporates having a healthier work force. Nudging employees
          to get their PMEs done is a stepping stone towards this vision. To achieve this, we propose to position PME as

          the process easier and streamlined.

          Life expectancy and prosperity have risen in developed and developing countries over the past 50 years and are
          expected to continue to rise . By 2020, the life expectancy in the developing world is expected to pass the 70
          years barrier, causing the world's life expectancy to continue to climb. Health was defined by the World
          Health Organization as the state of physical,mental and social well being, not merely the absence of disease
          or infirmity .
        </p>
        <p class="most-adults-need-a">
          Most adults need a thorough medical examination of which the frequency increases if there is a health problem
          that requires continuing care. The interval between checkups depends on age. Traders usually fall between the
          ages of 18 and 60 years and are expected to benefit maximally from periodic medical checkups because they are
          regularly under stress. Regular checkups save lives even when there is no specific<br />problem, since the
          absence of disagreeable symptoms does not necessarily guarantee that one is in good health. The main goals of
          a periodic medical examination are to diagnose treatable asymptomatic diseases . Some studies have also shown
          decreased<br />rates of invasive cancers and decreased mortality in people who undergo regular medical
          checkup.

        </p>
        <p class="a-periodic-health">
          A periodic health check up is important for traders because it leads to promotion of health and reduction in
          morbidity and mortality and the consequent reduction<br />in man hours and economic drain caused by diseases.
          The health of this group should be maintained to help in sustenance of the national economy. It is suspected
          that extremely long working hours increase the risk of sudden death from too much occupational stress . A
          case-control study carried out in Japan shows a U shaped relationship between mean monthly working hours and
          the risk of acutemyocardial infarction , hence a need for improved level of medical checkup among the working
          population. Also, providing preventive health services would decrease the demand by the elderly and result in
          a more effective use of health resources.
